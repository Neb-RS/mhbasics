## Harbour

Full of fresh air and plenty of sunshine, the Harbour seems to attract the types of mice who boast of sea salt in their veins.

### Chapter 5

Use the best weapon you have (which can be NVMRC Forcefield Trap or Shrink Ray Trap), Dehydration Base and Brie Cheese.

Buy Charm Conduit from Mountain Charm Shoppe. This allows you to equip Charms, a consumable that can boost trap stats and change area behaviour.

The gameplay in Mountain can be divided into three stages.

Stage 1: Boulder Breaking
    <ul>
    <li>Buy some Super Snowball Charm from Marketplace.</li>
    <li>Use Brie Cheese and equip Power Charm to deal damage to the boulder same as the Power of the charm equipped.</li>
    <li>Once you deal at least 1000 damage to the boulder, click Claim Chedd-Ore to claim.</li> <li>Chedd-Ore from the broken boulder.</li>
    <li>Repeat the cycle until you have obtained at least 15 Chedd-Ore Cheese.</li>
    </ul>
Stage 2: Mountain Climbing
    <ul>
    <li>Switch to Chedd-Ore Cheese and disarm charms. Do not trust the difficulty rating – you can still catch mice adequately without charms here.</li>
    <li>Once you have obtained 3 Faceted Sugar and 3 Iced Curd, craft Abominable Asiago Cheese using its 3 piece recipe. The 5 piece recipe is not worth its cost.</li>
    <li>Go back to Stage 1 to collect more Chedd-Ore Cheese if you don’t have enough Faceted Sugar and Iced Curd to craft Abominable Asiago.</li>
    </ul>
Stage 3: Boss
    <blockquote><ul>
    <li>Switch to Abominable Asiago Cheese to attract Abominable Snow Mouse.</li>
    <li>If you use up all Abominable Asiago Cheese without catching Abominable Snow, go back to previous stages. Repeat the cycle until you catch Abominable Snow Mouse.</li>
    <li>Abominable Snow Mouse drops Laboratory Map Piece.</li>
    </ul></blockquote>

Don’t use the looted Super Power Charm here.

Sell looted Small Power Charms and Orbs on Marketplace.

Claim the adventure Find the Hidden Mountain Pass after you have caught Abominable Snow Mouse.

Travel to Laboratory once you rank up to [Master](https://kuhmann.github.io/mhbasics/docs/NtGM/Master).
