[INSERT TABLE WITH STATS HERE]

### Weapon Acquisition
The Bottomless Grave can be bought directly from the Trapsmith for [X] Gold in a number of locations, most notably the Laboratory and the Mousoleum.

### general info or trivia
The bottomless grave is the first shadow weapon most hunters should aim for these days. Shadow has been a key component of earlygame gold farming for a long time, and to this day the bottomless grave is a key component to properly using how powerfull the Mousoleum is.  
In the past, the Bottomless Grave was significantly less desirable because it had a significantly higher cost. A major drop in price, combined with a buff to the mousoleum in it's ~~2019~~ rework, managed to change this and fundamentally reshape the earlier section of Shadow powertype.  

### Alternatives
The [Creepy Coffin Trap](https://kuhmann.github.io/mhbasics/docs/Appendix/weapons_per_powertype/Shadow/coffin) is an alternative to the bottomless grave. While being similar in stats and only accessible through either the marketplace or the premium shoppe, it has an area-specific effect in the Mousoleum that can make up for this downside depending on the resources you have available.
### Upgrades
After the bottomless grave, there are a number of potential weapons to go for. Shadow is in a bit of an awkward spot because it is quite underused or avoidable for a sizeable chunk of the game. The go-to upgrade after the bottomless grave is often the [Interdimensional Crossbow Trap](https://kuhmann.github.io/mhbasics/docs/Appendix/weapons_per_powertype/Shadow/IDCT).  
An in-between traps that can be considered is the [Clockapult of Time](https://kuhmann.github.io/mhbasics/docs/Appendix/weapons_per_powertype/Shadow/CoT). This upgrade is considered optional because it's use is quite minor: the only places it would be used are a low number of hunts in the Jungle of Dread, and in the Seasonal Garden to acquire a map piece. The next expected use would be in Fort Rox, however the Arcane ACRONYM beats it in catch rate here. Because of this, the Clockapult is considered unnecceseary.
